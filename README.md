# ToDoApp

ToDoApp is an application that helps you orginize the things you need to do. It consists of 2 screens: Active and Completed Tasks.

**Active screen** 

Here you can add list of things you need to do. For each activity you need to do you can choose one of three priorities available: low, medium, and high. Each priority has its own representative color to help you distinguish between activities better. 

**Completed screen**

When you complete some activity, you can mark it as completed and the activity is tranfered from active to completed screen. If you do not need some activity anymore, you can easily delete if from the list.
